# LEUART Embedded System Bluetooth Driver
This is my Embedded Low Energy UART Bluetooth Driver and Implementation on an HM-18 BLE Module, with the Thunderboard sense 2. I worked on this project in 2021 during my Embedded Systems course, which taught me valuable information about interrupts and interrupt handling, data transmission protocols, and more!
